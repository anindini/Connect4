# Connect4
Play against an AI

Connect4 is a game of perfect information and zero-sum. It can be solved by drawing a game tree describing each possible move made by the two players. 
This program implements an AI that plays against the user using the Minimax algorithm that has been optimised by the Alpha-Beta Pruning,
and Heuristic-Minimax algorithms.  
It can be run from the terminal or any IDLE, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
